# episode 22

## recap

Last we left off… our intreped adventurerers bartered and met with the leaders of the thieves guild, who after some discussion identified their goals to take the rule of the city into their own hands as their own movement has mounted considerably in the wake of the strikes and the ongoing war. You then discussed plans with Harper, trying to gauge their interest in a potential alliance, or perhaps attempting to pit the Lawful Raiment against the thieves. On top of this, the existence of some secretive plans to the military factory was revealed to you, and the guild implored your assitance in breaking in. Whichever path you take, you know the emporer and his entourage will arrive near the end of the week, and with him, likely more military forces. It is vital that you gain access to the canal before that time comes.
