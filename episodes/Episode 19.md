# Episode 19

Last we left off… following the multiple threads within Sesa your troop yesterday evening made their way from Margret Dupree’s mansion, across the grand canal bridge into the factory district to infiltrate the strikes. It being evening, the squadron of guards had died down significantly and many of the workers there were pitching their tents and making evening meals. You eavesdropped on a few conversations discovering that over the last weeks resources were running thin and some were deserting the factoies ranks, some fleeing south to the new republic, some simply moving on from the town to find work elsewhere. Your crew also noted a large, hangarlike, factory well guarded by the Lawful Raiment who patrolled its boarded exterior. Near that area you discovered the workers’ main base of opperations a factory converted into canteen and bunkhouse where many sat at long tables partaking their evening meal. After some sleuthing you approached Harper, the supposed leader of this movemnet, offering her a heafty sum of coin in exchange for her trust and conversation. Meanwhile, Sor ventured to the water front to investigate this supposed “water monster”. However, her lack of finesse and slight-of-handedness revealed her location and she suffered the fury of said monster. Cunningly she dug a hole into the ground and waited until the beings attacks subsided and the guard returned. Furious that she had caused such chaos, they swiftly  arrested her, dragging her to the city hall-like building at the center of town into a lower dungeon where she was locked away to await judgement. That evening, Malog’s room was infiltrated by the courrier who had deliverd his coinpurse earlier that day, but amazingly, Malog stopped this individual and they retreated into the dead of night. Aranmir visited the once pantheonic temple, now ruined by the monotheistic AEdism. And Junk? is high as balls.

## story

Vibes in the town. 

- There is a srike faction, these workers know that some secret govt. project is happening in the big factory having to do with baloons. The emporer should be coming in a week for the baloon festival, which means a tighter military presence. 
  - This strike is in someway linked to a large Water Elemental having been summoned within the Sesa Canal. This elemental is 10x as large as would be typical. 
- Margeret Dupree says that someone stole her book. This individual was a worker at one of the factories trained in thievery. They took it as they had been tipped off that it was within her inner sanctum of her library. 
  - Issac is the one who stole this book, having attempted to bastardise its magics. He was frustrated with the way things were going with the strikes and decided to distract the city guard by summoning an elemental but mistakenly transformed himself into an elemenal and bound himself to the canal area (hense why he never leaves) 
  - The book remains entangled with his person. His mind split as one that only knows what he was commanding, to kill the empire and its soldiers. The other half of him still exists and he can be saved but he will remain in a catatonic state forever. (or if regenerate is cast, his cerebelum is regenerated) Killing the monster will revert him to his normal form. 
- The thieves guild, which has largely been undiscovred, stalks within the sewers and is growing in size. A vast majority of those who join come from the workers. The theives goal is to establish a stateless society, they are looking to take over the local gov. as chaos controlls the city. 

Things to do:

- Explore the cave that Issac planned within. There they will find a map of the large airship factory, and diagrams of the airship. They wont really find anything of value (he was poor as fuck)
- They can persue the person who tried to steal from them, he’s from the theives guild looking to secure funds. They may find a way to track him to the entrance of the guild sewers where they’ll have to fight into. They can partner with the guild for support, perhaps convince them to work with them. 
- Infiltrate the airship bay, there is a hidden underground entrance if they’d like to try to go there, they’d need the plant diagrams. Otherwise the only known entrances are the fire escape (trapped and guarded) or the main entrance (guarded)

SOR IS GOING TO NEED TO GET OUT OF JAIL. SHE WILL REMAIN THERE UNTIL THE TRIAL WILL TAKE PLACE WHICH MAY NOT BE FOR SOME TIME.
