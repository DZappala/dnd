# episode 24

## recap

Last we left off, your crew had slain the water elemental within the harbor, reopening its waters for cross continental trade. With 4 days left until the emperor — or as you have discovered, the empress — arrives, you work tirelessly to thwart the plans of the colonel within this city. God… and this is how you thank people who throw parties for you. You told him where to locate the thieves guild and adamantly suggested they move on disbanding it tonight. As well, at said party, Sor warned her father about the impending trouble within the city. Meanwhile, your crew moves to take the military research factory, and you’ve told harper to go forward in rigging the bridge with explosives if or when the military makes their move. She let you know they’ll have marksman situated on their bank of the harbor ready to pick off as many town's guard as they can.

Elsewhere in the world, you know that Uric’s forces have moved to take the abandoned city of Indved and are likely preparing to trek through the swampland. 

## story

One by one, ships begin to hoist anchor, unfurl their sails, and ride under the gaping Bridge of Redemption. The port is open once again for business, the heartbeat of the city brought back to life. Even as you traverse the streets at night, there is a sense that the city is alive again as merchants unload long stalled goods from the Mageocracies to the East. Ships bearing the emblem of the Mageocratic Theocracy of Pershilia, the crest of the angelic swan and majestic winged unicorn, are among the most prevalent, and as they travel beneath the bridge, so close it feels as if you could lean over the edge and grab their main masts as they floated by. 

You continue your trek out past the factory district, along the riverbank, toward the cave, identified to you by the discovery of a map drawn by an eccentric factory worker, who just wanted to make the city a better place, but was clouded by the promise within a book that housed magics far beyond the realm of a human mind. A book that you now possess. As you walk, Malog, you hear a voice in your head, "Malog, I've been told that the harbor is cleared, is this true? Is it safe to move up the canal?" It's Dhekhar.

1. - They break into the facility
     - A long and methodical battle, they will discover the airship.
     - The lower floors, entering via the tunnel system.
       - They know the entrance because of the map drawn in illusory script
       - They will venture down the tunnel, unabated
       - They arrive at a door after about 5 minutes, they open the door and step into another dimension
         - This dimension in a pocket dimension of the Udth’derkaz (outer darkness) created by the power of the orcish god
         - *You step through the threshold into a hall of imperceivable  darkness. As if darkness itself had been swallowed up by some extra-dimensional force, yet still within your purview. At the end of the hallway is a door similar in shade to the one you entered. You’re overcome with this feeling that all that is no longer is and is at the same time. Do you proceed?*
         - *As you begin to conceptualize venturing through this next door  and you move your feet forward the space to your left, up, front, and  behind begins to warp around you and you can sense yourself stepping  though you make no contact with any surface as the door in front of you  stretches to an astronomical degree and then is suddenly in front of you in an instant. You look behind you and see only darkness and have to  crane your neck farther than you can imagine it should be able to rotate in order to see the door you stepped through some infinite distance  below you and to your right. And as you open the door that now lies  before you, you step out into a room lined with wooden planks. Roll a  constitution saving throw.*
           - Failure: *as you make contact with the wooded floor below you,  you feel the blood rush to your brain, and a warm trickle of crimson  begins to leak from your nostrils. Your mind begins to piece together  what just happened and you instinctively begin to vomit on the floor*
           - Success: *as you make contact with the wooded floor below you,  you feel the blood rush to your head and you immediately sit trying to  stomach what just happened, you feel a wave of nausea wash over you but  you quickly stifle it trying to piece together a memory of the  experience you just had, only to realize you are unable to.*
           - Sor, can easily succeed this, followed by malog, junk and Jal’real will have an extremely difficult time.
           - Malog feels the presence of his god closer than ever before.
       - In the wooden room they must begin to investigate.
         - There are many baddies in and around here.
       - Loot:
         - 500pt in a lockbox (difficult), magically trapped, 10d10 lightning damage on failure
         - The plans and signatures of Relorun Industries, sitting atop a table, many books, some with writings of calculations and sketches of the dimensions of the airship being built within this hangar. There is a pile of pages near a wastebasket that have been crumpled and cast aside. 
         - The signatures of Sor’s father and crest of the House of Asha
           - Dear Mdm. Birdwell, enclosed is the sum agreed to for the  progression of the arc project. The contract binding this agreement  entitles you to use these funds for the purpose of acquiring and  transporting materials for the Arc project, and any other means of use  will result in your immediate death. This Judgment of execution vested  in my by the High Empress, His holy servant, Thyra Margazia. (Signed:)  Patriarch Alistaire of House Asha
         - by doing the factory thing, they will offer junk to make wings :)
