# episode 24

## recap

Last we left off, your crew slew the water elemental within the harbor, reopening its waters for cross continental trade. With 4 days left until the emporer – or as you have discovered, the **empress** – arives, you work tirelessly to thwart the plans of the colonel within this city. God… and this is how you thank people who throw parties for you.  You told him where to locate the thieves guild and adamantly suggested they move on disbanding it tonight. As well, at said party, Sor warned her father about the impending trouble within the city. Meanwhile, your crew moves to take the military research factory, and you’ve told harper to go forward in rigging the bridge with exposives if and when the military makes their move. She let you know they’ll have marksman situated on their bank of the harbor ready to pick off as many townsguard as they can.

Elsewhere in the world, you know that Uric’s forces have moved to take the abandoned city of Indved and are likely preparing to trek through the swampland. 

## story

Ships, one by one begin to hoist anchor, unfurl their sails, and ride under the gaping Bridge of Redemption. The port is open once again for buisiness, the heartbeat of the city brought back to life. Even as you traverse the streets at night, there is a sense that the city is alive again as merchants unload long awaited goods from the Mageocracies to the East. Ships bearing the emblem of the Mageocratic Theocracy of Pershilia, the crest of the angelic swan and magestic winged unicorn,  are among the most prevelant, and as they travel beneath the bridge, so close it feels as if you could lean over the edge and grab their main masts as they floated by.
