# Episode 18

## recap

Last we left off… your group made their way into the heart of Sesa to come upon a strike in the factory district. Soldiers decked in dark grey and turquoise armor seemed in a tense standoff with some of the local craftsmen. Then, when attempting to enter into the city by its main bridge, you were halted and asked to wait for an escort. The guard on duty informed you that a water elemental had been terrorizing the waters in the harbor preventing trade and attacking those who crossed the bridge. Following some shopping, and a deal made with an interesting wine salesman, you checked into an inn and made your way up the hillside to the estates to the home of Margaret Duprée, where Sor rather unexpectedly ran into her family, or more specificaly, her brother. During your meeting with Mrs. Duprée, you discovered that the tome which Malog had seeked had been stolen some years prior and while an investigation was conducted by the Lawful Raiment, they were unable to ascertain the theif, and the case remained open. 

## story

We pick back up at the inn “The Angel and Sadle” where they left off. When they arrive, the runner with their package has not yet arrived. After some time of waiting and/or eating, Malog will get a knock on their door and a Human by the name of “Claudius Kearny” (though his real name is Harouldus [hu-roll-dus] Kerry) will deliver their money. During the night however, Kerry returns to rob Malog. Malog will roll a perception check at disadvantage, against his stealth, If they notice they can

1) **Persue him** and he will attempt to escape (though he is very good at stealth so…)
   1) He will make stealth rolls, if malog notices, roll initiative, he will try to hold person or escape. 
   2) if they catch him he will try to weasel his way out, they may try to take him captive, who knows
2) **Wait it out**. Try to look for him in the morning. 
   1) they can ask arround, perhaps the market, to figure out what’s going on

There are many things that can happen from here.

- **Investigate the money dissapearing**
  - This will lead them to the theives guild. They could ask arround the shadier parts of town looking for who did it, too many questions might be dangerous but they could bribe or persuade someone to give them information. 
- **Talk to the lawful raiment**
  - The leader (colonel) of this group may need some persuading to get them information. They are dealing with the stikes right now and this elemental monster.
    - If asked why the army cant take care of it, he may say, much of their resources have been diverted, and they’re occupied with the strikes, if pressed he’ll reveal that the stroinium weaponry, what little they have, seemed to have no affect on the beast. 
    - He will tell them it showed up one day about a week ago out of thin air, and just started terrorizing any ship that got close. He wonders why it didn’t destroy the bridge yet. 
    - He will also complain about how the elites just want their precious baloon festival to go on. 
    - May mention the factories have been developing this new mobile balloon technology. Something the governmnet has been working on, he doesn’t know. Supposedly the Emporeer or his entourage is supposed to be coming in to town to unveil their project. With the rebellions and the strikes he doesn’t know how likely this is anymore. (It is however why many pershilians are in town as of late, they’re brokering arms deals with the empire.)
- **The Cave**
  - Last they knew of the book thing was there was a cave on the outskirts of town well into the hills that they had tracked the assailant to, but when they arrived, nothing, the cave was empty. 
  - They can venture there, sniff around, find an illusory barrier. They will then have to delve deep into the what seems to be an abandoned mine, then at the end discover a warlock/necromantic sancutm. There they will find all sorts of notes and symbols from the orcish god. Something indicating that this is a factory worker.  

- **There is a strike going on in the city**
  - As they get closer to the city center they’ll notice a large amount of ships stalled out in the bay surrounding the entrance to the canal.
  - The Labourers of Sesa Royal Steelworks are striking becasue of poor wages and overtime. They will pass this strike as the Iron works is south of the canal by the bridge. 
  - They have summoned a large water elemental in the harbor that is preventing ships from passing through.
  - They must somehow get the elemental out of the way becuase Dhekar had asked them to find a way to get their ships thorugh the canal. 
  - If they talk to the Col. of the town, he will note that all the nobility cares about is getting the balllon ceremony under way. He is very close to being pressured into a massacre, but understands that if he starts shooting people there’s going to be a revolt. He lacks armament due to the crown pushing military supplies to the south. 
  - The navy is off on a military expedition in the North-east aiding the draconians. 
- **The Balloon Ceremony**
  - The crown has been working on a hot air balloon system. 
  - They can talk to Pleasance Berdwell, the chief engineer who is excited to tell them about the hot air baloon she has been designing. Ever since she noticed that hot air when placed under fabric then causes the fabric to rize. 
  - She is indifferent to the strike. 
  - The thieves gulid is attempting to sabotage her balloons, every day fabric and supplies are missing from her stock. They can investigate this.
  - She has a secret: she knows who and where relorun industries are/is.
