# episode 23

## recap

Last we left off. Our adventurers explored the last few leads they had in the city of Sesa, trying to decide which faction to align with, determine who was trustworty, and ultimately lay down a final plan to take the canal and city before the emporer arrives in a matter of days. They spoke to Uric who helped Jalreal read the map enscribed with illusory script and outlined how the forces of Bratera had made ground: a few border towns in Bjerkenia had secceded to Bratera; their forces had repeled the inital margazian counterforce, and they planed to move toward the abandoned city of Indved within the week; Dhekar had successfully recieved the Bjerkenian navy in exchange for a favorable Stroinium trade deal. Now our adventurers have settled on their final tasks, to deal with the monster in Sesa Harbor, and break into the governemnt military facility.

## story

- They break into the facility
  - A long and methoidical battle, they will discover the airship. 
  - The lower floors, entering via the tunnel system.
    - They know the entrance becuase of the map drawn in illusory script
    - They will venture down the tunnel, unabated 
    - They arrive at a door after about 5 minutes, they open the door and step into another dimension
      - This dimension in a pocket dimension of the Udth’derkaz (outer darkness) created by the power of the orcish god 
      - *You step throught the threshold into a hall of impercievable darkness. As if darkness itself had been swallowed up by some extradimensional force, yet still within your perview. At the end of the halway is a door similar in shade to the one you entered. You’re overcome with this feeling that all that is no longer is and is at the very same time. Do you proceed?*
      - *As you begin to conceptualize venturing through this next door and you move your feet forward the space to your left, up, front, and behind begins to warp around you and you can sense yourself stepping though you make no contact with any surface as the door in front of you stretches to an astronomical degree and then is sunndenly infront of you in an instant. You look behind you and see only darkness and have to crane your neck farther than you can imagine it should be able to rotate in order to see the door you stepped through some infinite distance below you and to your right. And as you open the door that now lies before you, you step out into a room lined with wooden planks. Roll a constitution saving throw.*
      - Malog feels the presense of his god closer than ever before.
        - Failure: *as you make contact with the wooded floor below you, you feel the blood rush to your brain, and a warm trickle of crimson begins to leak from your nostrils. Your mind begins to piece together what just happend and you instintually begin to vomit on the floor*
        - Success: *as you make contact with the wooded floor below you, you feel the blood rush to your head and you immediately sit trying to stommach what just happend, you feel a wave of nausea wash over you but you quickly stiffle it trying to piece together a memory of the experience you just had, only to realise you are unable to.*
        - Sor, can easilly succed this, followed by malog, junk and Jal’real will have an extremely difficult time. 
    - In the wooden room they must begin to investigae. 
      - There are many baddies in and arround here.
    - Loot:
      - 500pt in a lockbox (difficult), magiclally trapped, 10d10 lightning damage on failure
      - The plans and signatures of Relorun Industries, sitting atop a table
      - The signatures of Sor’s father and crest of the House of Asha
        - Dear Mdm. Birdwell, enclosed is the sum agreed to for the progression of the arc project. The contract binding this agreement entitles you to use these funds for the purpose of accuring and transporting materials for the Arc project, and any other means of use will result in your immediate death.
