# episode 21

## recap

Last we left off… continuing on your mission to subvert yourselves into the community of sesa, whilst dodging the focus of the guards. After a brazen prison escape, your group made their way that evening into the confines of the black market along the edge of town, quite overtly finding your way into the sewer system.

## story

They continue purchases if they’d like. What they see after: many people from the factory on days prior, lots of new recruits. 

They may, if they want, speak to the leader, Kaela Paxton. Who will explain her perspective.

Things to do:

- break into the govt facility
- continue in the thieves guild
- Kill Issac’s Monster

At the govt facility

- they can break in the front door or spend a lot of time finding a secret entrance.
- there they’ll find a more or less completed airship they could… steal? and use to kill the mosnter?
- drop clues about relorun industries. the girl who runs the workers there seems to know about them

At the thieves guild

- they see several workers from the day before. as a matter of fact, this is where lots of workers are fleeing to. 
- they meet the leader (julios mom lmao) (julio is the guy from the college)
- they will help but also they want to destroy the baloon factory
- they want anarchy, not best but they have numbers tho.
