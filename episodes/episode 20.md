# episode 20

## recap

Last we left off… following through on your mission from Uric to open the canal and secure Sesa, your crew followed a few open threads into the city. You met with margeret dupree to coherce her into giveing you a powerful tome, but it was stollen years prior. Then you found you way into the strikes, making allies with its head Harper. There you learned of a factory worker named issac who had seemly gotten mixed up in some dark magics and the oddly coincidental appearence of a gargantuan water elemental that appeared in sesa harbor on the day of his dissapearence. His wife told you about a cave he ventured to often up in the hills of sesa. You also learned of a secret governement project occuring within a large hangarlike factory under heavy guard. Sor was arrested and made a daring escape from prison releasing everyone and beating the guards while everyone else met with the captain of the guard in response to a robbery the night before. Later, most of the crew ventured to a liberal arts college and met with the less than savory librarian dealing in less than legal magical goods. There, you traded coin for information, and learned about a secret entrance into some underground passages where local criminals hang out.

Things to do:

-  break into the govt facility

At the govt facility

- they can break in the front door or spend a lot of time finding a secret entrance.
- there they’ll find a more or less completed airship they could… steal? and use to kill the mosnter?

At the cave

- they can search through illusions and find issac’s cache, there they find mementos to his family, including a letter to his wife (sad)
- stacks of blank papers, on which if dispelled, they find also the plant plans where the secret entrance is revealed. slight references to relorun in illusory script

At the thieves guild
