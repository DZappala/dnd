## Strike

### recap

Last we left off… your crew fended off a demonic entity that had trapped you within the confines of its lair. Closely defeating its onslaught of unded soldiers, you escaped north. Traversing through the swamp you found your way into the outskirts of Sesa alongisde the now heavily industrialized canal area. There, you took refuge within “The Proud Sailor,” where you enjoyed a hot bath and bed down for the evening. 

### story

When they wake, they note that outside, now that it is light, ships are not passing through the canal. 

They note that a large column of smoke rises from the North side of the city. 

Things that could happen:

- **They visit Margaret Duprée**
  - Her manor is nestled within the hilss that surround Sesa’s north.
  - A long silvery gravel drive leads up to her mansion. 
  - She has a large book collection
  - If asked about the Old book Malog is looking for, or if they go to find it, they will discover that it had been stollen some time ago. [book is stowed in a cave near a villlage to the north, they may be able to find clues that lead them to this location]
- **There is a strike going on in the city**
  - As they get closer to the city center they’ll notice a large amount of ships stalled out in the bay surrounding the entrance to the canal.
  - The Labourers of Sesa Royal Steelworks are striking becasue of poor wages and overtime. They will pass this strike as the Iron works is south of the canal by the bridge. 
  - They have summoned a large water elemental in the harbor that is preventing ships from passing through.
  - They must somehow get the elemental out of the way becuase Dhekar had asked them to find a way to get their ships thorugh the canal. 
  - If they talk to the Col. of the town, he will note that all the nobility cares about is getting the balllon ceremony under way. He is very close to being pressured into a massacre, but understands that if he starts shooting people there’s going to be a revolt. He lacks armament due to the crown pushing military supplies to the south. 
  - The navy is off on a military expedition in the North-east aiding the draconians. 
- **The Balloon Ceremony**
  - The crown has been working on a hot air balloon system. 
  - They can talk to Pleasance Berdwell, the chief engineer who is excited to tell them about the hot air baloon she has been designing. Ever since she noticed that hot air when placed under fabric then causes the fabric to rize. 
  - She is indifferent to the strike. 
  - The thieves gulid is attempting to sabotage her balloons, every day fabric and supplies are missing from her stock. They can investigate this.
  - She has a secret: she knows who and where relorun industries are/is.





- **The train**
  - The large collumn of smoke comes from the steam trains and rail yards to the north-west of Sesa.
  - If they ask someone about the smoke they’ll laugh and say something like, “what you haven’t seen a train before?”
